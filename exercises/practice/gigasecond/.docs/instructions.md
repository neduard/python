# Instructions

Given a `datetime` describing a moment in time, determine the moment that would be after a _gigasecond_
has passed.

A _gigasecond_ is equal to 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

# Examples
```python
add(datetime.datetime(2021, 8, 13, 15, 5, 2)) -> datetime.datetime(2053, 4, 21, 16, 51, 42)
```
